- switch to vertical card layout
  - slight card/paper texture?
- redo stack UI
  - a stack of the cards, with slight rotation to express the depth
  - create an opaque rect area around the stack to change color on hover
- deck should only reveal top card, rest should be flipped over, back of card should have a texture/graphic
- better background texture, should feel like a poker board

- counter showing how many you've gotten right

- side effect to move the incorrect card to the correct stack on game lose, after a delay
  - this should actually translate the position somehow

- on game end, show giant list of all wiki pages with title, description, image, link

- on game end, show new game button, share button
